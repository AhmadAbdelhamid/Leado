    <string name="lesson_text">The first building block of emotional intelligence is self-awareness. Self-awareness is
        our ability to recognize our own emotions and their effects on us and others. Without being aware of and
        understanding our own emotions, it will be difficult for us to move into the other emotional competencies like
        self-management, social awareness, or team leadership.Self-improvement is also referred to as
        personal-development can be said as the improvement to one’s own mind and characterthrough one’s own efforts. It
        is a conscious process where one decides to take oneself in hand and change their life-for the
        better(introduction to self improvement).
